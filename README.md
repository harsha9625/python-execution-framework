# Python Execution & Automated Test Framework

This project implements a Python execution engine that dynamically runs scripts with injected variables, captures output, and validates behavior using automated test cases. It simulates a lightweight code evaluation pipeline similar to coding platforms.

---

## Features

- Dynamic Python script execution
- Runtime variable injection
- Output capture and error handling
- Automated test case validation
- JSON-driven testing workflow
