# Python Execution & Automated Test Framework

This project implements a Python execution engine that dynamically runs scripts with injected variables, captures output, and validates behavior using automated test cases.

## Features

- Dynamic Python script execution
- Runtime variable injection
- Output capture and error handling
- Automated test case validation
- JSON-driven testing pipeline

## Project Structure

executor.py → Executes Python scripts  
runner.py → Runs automated test cases  
sample_script.py → Example script  
test_cases.json → Test inputs  

## How to Run

python runner.py

## Purpose

Designed to simulate scalable code evaluation pipelines similar to online coding platforms.
