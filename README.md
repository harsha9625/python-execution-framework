# Python Execution & Automated Test Framework

This project implements a Python execution engine that dynamically runs scripts with injected variables, captures output, and validates results using automated test cases.

## Features

- Dynamic Python script execution
- Runtime variable injection
- Output capture and error handling
- Automated test validation
- JSON-based test case workflow

## Project Structure

pyexecutor/
  executor.py     → Core execution engine

runner.py         → Automated test runner  
sample_script.py  → Example script  
test_cases.json   → Test inputs  

## How to Run

python runner.py

## Purpose

Simulates a lightweight code evaluation pipeline similar to coding platforms.
